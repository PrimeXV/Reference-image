        <h2>Making music isn't easy, It takes time, effort, and learning. But when you're in the flow, it's incredibly
            rewarding.</h2>
        <p>We feel the same way about making Ableton products. The driving force behind Ableton is our passion for what
            we make, and the people we make it for.</p>

        <h2>We are more than 350 people from 30 different countries divided between our headquarters in Berlin and our
            offices in Los Angeles and Tokyo.</h2>
        <p>Most of us are active musicians, producers, and DJs, and many of us use Live and Push everyday. We came from
            a wide range of cultural and professional backgrounds. Some of us have PhDs, some are self-taught, and most
            of us are somewhere in between. What connects us in the shared belief that each of us has the skills and
            knowledge to contribute to something big: helping to shape the future of music culture.</p>

        <h2>We believe it takes focus to create truly outstanding instruments. We only work on a few products and we

        <p>Rather than having a one-size-fits-all process, we try to give our people what they need to work their magic
            and grow. We've learned that achieving the best result comes from building teams that are richly diverse,
            and thus be able to explore problems from a wider set of perspectives. We don't always agree with each other
            , but opinion and debate are valued and openly encouraged.</p>

        <p>Alongside an internal training program, employees are actively supported in acquiring new knowledge and
            skills, and coached on applying these in their daily work. In addition, staff-organized development and
            music salons are a chance to discuss new technologies, production techniques and best practices.</p>
